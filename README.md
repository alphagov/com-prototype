# Content Performance Manager

A data warehouse that stores content and content metrics, to help content owners measure and improve content on GOV.UK.

This repository contains:
- Extract, transform, load (ETL) processes for populating the data warehouse
- An internal tool for exploring the data (AKA the sandbox)
- [An API that exposes metrics and content changes][api-doc]

Data is combined from multiple sources, including the [publishing platform](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api), user analytics, [user feedback](https://github.com/alphagov/feedback).

## Introduction ##

- [What is a data warehouse and its role in GOV.UK][data-warehouse-what-why]
- [Database schema: star schema][data-warehouse-schema]

## Live examples

- [List all metrics](https://content-performance-manager.publishing.service.gov.uk/api/v1/metrics)
- [Last month of data for all organisations](https://content-performance-manager.publishing.service.gov.uk/content?date_range=last-month&search_term=&document_type=all&organisation_id=all)

## Nomenclature

- **Data warehouse**: the database where we store all the metrics.
- **ETL**: [extract, transform, load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) - how we get data into the data warehouse.
- **Fact**: a record containing measurements/metrics
- **Dimension**: a characteristic that provides context for a fact (such as the time it was extracted, or the content item it belongs to)
- **Star schema**: The way we structure data in the data warehouse using fact and dimension tables

## Technical documentation

This is a Ruby on Rails application that stores over time performance metrics and content changes and exposes this information via an API. It is built on a PostgreSQL 9.6 database.

### Dependencies

- [GOV.UK Publishing API](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api)

### Shared resources

We have a [number of shared resources][shared-resources] we share with other GOV.UK applications. These are documented [here][shared-resources]

## Running the application

See the [getting started guide](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/getting-started.html) for instructions about setting up and running your development VM.

```bash
cd /var/govuk/govuk-puppet/development-vm
bowl content-performance-manager
 ```

The application can be accessed from http://content-performance-manager.dev.gov.uk, and will be installed on port 3206 on your Dev environment.

### Running the test suite

To run the test suite:
 ```bash
 $ bundle exec rake
 ```

## Populating data

If you are a GOV.UK developer using the development VM, you can [run the replication script to populate the database](doc/import_production_data.md).

### Run ETL processes locally

- To run the ETL process locally, you need to  [set up Google Analytics credentials in development](doc/google_analytics_setup.md).
